# TaskForge Flutter App

A comprehensive project management mobile application built with Flutter, integrated with a hybrid backend architecture (GraphQL + REST + MongoDB + PostgreSQL).

## 🎉 Full Integration Achieved

The Flutter app has been successfully integrated with the complete backend hybrid architecture (GraphQL + Prisma + MongoDB + REST API).

## ✅ What's Been Integrated

### 1. **Authentication System**
- **Login/Register screens** with full UI
- **JWT token management** with secure storage
- **Auto-login functionality** on app restart
- **Logout with token cleanup**

### 2. **Navigation Structure**
- **Bottom navigation** with 4 main tabs
- **Splash screen** during app initialization
- **Auth wrapper** for automatic routing
- **Material Design 3** theming

### 3. **Core Screens**
- **Dashboard**: Overview with stats and recent projects
- **Projects Screen**: List all projects with CRUD operations
- **Tasks Screen**: Real-time task management with GraphQL streams
- **Profile Screen**: User management and app settings

### 4. **Hybrid API Integration**
- **GraphQL client** for real-time task/project data
- **REST client** for file uploads and authentication
- **Service layer** abstracting API complexity
- **Error handling** and retry mechanisms

### 5. **Data Models**
- **Type-safe Dart models** with JSON serialization
- **Generated .g.dart files** for automatic serialization
- **Full compatibility** with backend GraphQL schema

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials → `AuthService.login()`
2. REST API validates → Returns JWT token
3. Token stored securely → GraphQL client initialized
4. Navigate to main app → Auto-login on restart

### Task Management Flow
1. UI requests tasks → `TaskService.watchTasks()`
2. GraphQL subscription → Real-time updates from MongoDB
3. Task operations (CRUD) → Hybrid service layer
4. File attachments → REST API for uploads
5. Analytics data → GraphQL queries to PostgreSQL

### Project Management Flow
1. Project list → GraphQL query from MongoDB
2. Export/Import → REST API for file operations
3. Member management → GraphQL mutations
4. Project analytics → PostgreSQL via GraphQL

## 🎯 Key Features Working

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- Tasks update automatically via GraphQL subscriptions
- Live data synchronization across all screens
- Offline caching with automatic sync when online

### ✅ File Operations
- Upload task attachments via REST API
- Project export/import functionality
- Profile picture management

### ✅ Error Handling
- Network error handling with retry
- Authentication error handling
- User-friendly error messages

### ✅ Offline Support
- GraphQL cache for offline viewing
- Secure token storage
- Data persistence across app restarts
